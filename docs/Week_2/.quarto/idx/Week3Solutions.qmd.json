Create an object called `US_births_2013` which focuses only on data corresponding to 2013 births.\n\n```{r task1.1-solution, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE}\n#Further Task 1.1 Solution\nUS_births_2013 <- US_births_2000_2014 |> filter(year == 2013)\n```\n\n2.  By only choosing births data for the years 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014 create a new dataframe called `US_births_small` and check that this resulting data frame has 1461 rows. Note that there are many different ways to do this, but try and come up with three different ways using:\n\n-   the \"or\" operator `|`\n-   the `%in%` operator\n-   the \"not\" operator `!` or combinations of them.\n\n```{r task1.2-solution, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}\n#Further Task 1.2 Solution\nUS_births_small <- US_births_2000_2014 |> \n  filter(year %in% c(2010, 2011, 2012, 2014))\n\nUS_births_small <- US_births_2000_2014 |> \n  filter(!(year %in% c(2000:2009, 2013, 2015)))\n\nUS_births_small <- US_births_2000_2014 |> \n  filter(year == 2010 | year == 2011 | year == 2012 | year == 2014)\n```\n\n3.  Suppose we are interested in choosing rows for only weekdays (not Saturdays or Sundays) for `day_of_week` in year 2013. Write the code to do so and give the name `US_births_weekdays_2013` to the resulting data frame. (Note that you may want to run `US_births_2000_2014 |> distinct(day_of_week)` to identify the specific values of `day_of_week`.)\n\n```{r task1.3-solution, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}\n#Further Task 1.3 Solution\nUS_births_weekdays_2013 <- US_births_2000_2014 |> \n  filter(!(day_of_week %in% c('Sat','Sun')), year==2013)\nUS_births_weekdays_2013 <- US_births_2000_2014 |> \n  filter(!(day_of_week %in% c('Sat','Sun')) & year==2013)\n```\n\n```{=tex}\n\\newpage\n4\n```\n. Using what you covered in **Week 1: Visualization**, produce an appropriate plot looking at the pattern of births on all weekdays in 2013 coloured by the particular day of the week. (Remember to load the package `ggplot2`).\n\n```{r task1.4-solution, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}\n#Further Task 1.4 Solution\nggplot(US_births_weekdays_2013, aes(x=date,y=births, color=day_of_week))+\n  geom_line()+ \n  labs(x='Date', y='Number of births', \n       title='Number US births on week days in 2013')\n```\n\n5.  The plot in the previous task has shown there are some outliers in the data for US births on weekdays in 2013. We can use the summarize function to get an idea for how these outliers may affect the shape of the births variable in `US_births_weekdays_2013`. Write some code to calculate the mean and median values for all weekday birth totals in 2013. Store this aggregated data in the data frame `birth_summ`. What do these values suggest about the effects of the outliers?\n\n```{r task1.5-solution, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}\n#Further Task 1.5 Solution\nbirth_summ <- US_births_weekdays_2013 |> \n  summarize(mean_births =  mean(births),\n            median_births = median(births))\nbirth_summ\n\n#Comparing the mean and the median values we see they are not very different, \n#showing that the potential outliers are not distorting the shape of \n```\n\n6.   Instead of looking at the overall mean and median across all of 2013 weekdays, calculate the mean and median for each of the five different weekdays throughout 2013. Using the same names for the columns as in the `birth_summ` data frame in the previous exercise, create a new data frame called `birth_day_summ`.\n\n```{r task1.6-solution, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}\n#Further Task 1.6 Solution\nbirth_day_summ <- US_births_weekdays_2013 |>\n  summarize( mean_births =  mean(births),\n             median_births = median(births),.by = c(day_of_week))\nbirth_day_summ\n```\n\n7.   Using the aggregated data in the `birth_day_summ data` frame, produce this barplot.\n\n```{r FT1, echo=FALSE,  purl=FALSE}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"Week2FurtherTask1Barchart.png\")\n```\n\n```{r task1.7-solution, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}\n#Further Task 1.7 Solution\nggplot(birth_day_summ, aes(x=day_of_week,y=mean_births, fill=day_of_week))+ \n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE)+ \n  labs(x='Day of Week', y='Average number of births', \n       title='Average US births by weekday, 2013')\n  \n```\n\n\\newpage\n\n**Further Task 2**\n\nIn this task we will work with the dataset analysed and reported in the 2014 article from FiveThirtyEight.com entitled \"41 Percent Of Fliers Think You're Rude If You Recline Your Seat\" [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/airplane-etiquette-recline-seat/).\n\nThe data set is called `flying` and is in the `fivethirtyeight` package.\n\n1.  Write code to determine the proportion of respondents in the survey that responded with \"Very\" when asked if a passenger reclining their seat was rude.
