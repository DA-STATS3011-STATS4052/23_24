    "text": "This week we will take what we have learned in previous weeks and produce a report using Quarto . Quarto is a multi-language system that allows reports and presentation to be created within R, thus allowing for R code and output to be easily embedded within a report, a presentation or even a Blog! Hence, all of the R code and plots obtained from an analysis are contained within a single file.\nYou can find below an example of a report produced with Quarto relating to fitting a regression model using one numerical explanatory. You can toggle the &lt;/&gt; Code button in the html file to see the source code that produced this file. It is advised to have this document open while working through the remaining sections in order to see examples put into practice.\n\n\n\n Download Example report\n\n\n\nThe following sections will take you through the different steps required to produce this report in Quarto. For creating a new Quarto file from scratch see Section 1.1, otherwise move onto Section 2.\n\nIf you want to create a new R Markdown document from scratch within RStudio you can go to:\nFile -&gt; New File -&gt; Quarto  Document...\nThis will open the following window within RStudio:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBefore creating your first Quarto document, be sure that you have the latest RStudio version installed.\n\n\nFrom here select Document and the Default Output Format as PDF or HTML. Give your document a title and select OK. This will open within RStudio an empty .qmd file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can download this template containing simple instructions on how to do some basic stuff using Quarto . To see what the HTML/PDF of the template document looks like click on the Render button at the top of the document window."

    "section": "\n4.1 Code chunks",
    "text": "4.1 Code chunks\nCode chunks allow for R code to be embedded within a document. Not only can the code be easily included within a document, the code can also be evaluated. Hence, you can produce an entire report based on an analysis that is contained within a single file instead of having separate files containing your R code, plot images and comments.\nR Code can be evaluated directly on the Quarto document or in the R console (the latter would be similar to run your code from an R script). To select where you want your code to be evaluated click on the setting options  (next to the Render button  ) and choose between Chunk Output Inline (default) if you want your code to be evaluated within the Quarto document or Chunk Output in Console to evaluate your code directly on the R console. If you select the latter, the following options will be added to the document preamble:\neditor_options: \n  chunk_output_type: inline\nTo add an R Code Chunk you can simply click on the  symbol (or using keyboard shortcut cmd+alt+i or ctrl+alt+i for windows users) on either visual or source modes.\nR code chunks are identified with {r} with multiple (optional) chunk options which we can access by typing #| at the beginning of the line.\n\n\nvisual mode view\nsource mode view\n\n\n\nIf you are on visual mode the R chunks will appear as follow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are in the source mode the R chunks will appear as follow:\n```{r}\n#| \n\n```\n\n\n\nSome of the most common arguments you will use in your R Chunks are:\n\n\necho: include the R code within the code chunk in the document (true/false);\n\neval: evaluate the R code within the code chunk (true/false);\n\nwarning: suppress warnings from R (true/false); and\n\nmessage: suppress messages from R (true/false).\n\nFor example, let’s say we wanted to select the score and bty_avg variables from the evals data set to be used later, we can do that using the following code chunk:\n{r}\n#| echo: false\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(moderndive)\nevals.scores &lt;- evals |&gt;\n  select(score, bty_avg)\nSetting echo: false will tell the R to evaluate the code while hiding the R chunk from the main document. In this example, we will store the subsetted data set as the object evals.scores so that it can be used later . If you want to embed the code within the Quarto document then you would simply set echo: true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nR chunk options are case sensitive! so echo: TRUE or echo: FALSE won’t work! You can use R Studio autocomplete feature the see the available options by pressing the tab key.\n\n\nNote that by default Quarto will set echo: true . Alternatively, you can edit the Quarto preamble and change the global output options to show or hide all R chunks. You can do this within the execute options as follows (you can manually override this by changing the echo option in each individual chunk) :\n---\ntitle: \"My title\"\nnumber-sections: true\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou need to be very careful with the indentation if you decide to change the global settings of Quarto preamble!\n\n\nLets look at another example:\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\nlibrary(gapminder)\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nIn this case, we set warning and message to false to indicate that we want to suppress any warnings or messages (e.g., the ones that you usually get when loading R packages). Another useful option is eval. If we set eval: false then we indicate that we don’t want the chunk output to be included in the rendered document (this is useful for example if we just want to show our R code without rendering its output):\n#| eval: false\n\nggplot(data=evals.scores,aes(y=score,x=bty_avg)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that we can still run the code in each individual chunk (even if we set eval: false) by clicking the run chunk bottom. The code will be evaluated in either your .qmd file or in the console depending on the Chunk output settings (this mean that you can test your code in R but its output won’t be rendered in the final document).\n\n\nAdditional arguments can be passed to code chunks other than those displayed above. The most useful ones other than those relate to figure sizing and positioning and are discussed in the upcoming sections."

    "text": "4.2 Inline code\nR code can be included within text by enclosing the code with `r `. This allows for expressions to be evaluated by R and not be hardwired by the user. For example, if you wanted to convey the number of observations within evals.scores then we can enclose nrow(evals.scores) within `r ` to obtain the number of observations, rather than hardwiring 463 into the text. This can help to prevent potential human error when presenting information. It can also help with consistency and ease-of-use, since n = nrow(evals.scores) could be stored as an R object and referred to whenever necessary within the text using inline R code."

Alignment of the columns is done using colons, that is, for left alignment put :---, for right alignment put ---:, and for centred alignment put :---:. For these sorts of tables, you can add a caption below the table and then include a #tbl- label in braces at the end of the caption for cross-referencing.\n\n\n\nFor example, the table above corresponding to the first 5 rows of the iris data can be produced by hand by clicking on the Table option in the toolbar (next to Insert▾ while using the visual mode) and selecting the number of rows and columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can read more about authoring Quarto tables here."

For example @fig-scatterplot1 will create a hyperlink to Figure 1. Then we added a figure caption using the fig-cap option. For size and positioning of the figure we can include:\n\n\nfig.width: an integer value denoting the width of the figure;\n\nfig.height: an integer value denoting the height of the figure;\n\nfig.align: the alignment of the figure within the body of the document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Question\n\n\n\nWhat other argument would you need to include if you wish to show the chunk plot output only?\n\neval: false\necho: true\necho: false\neval: true\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can read more about authoring Quarto figures here."
