    "text": "3.1 Introduction\nTypically a project will have one main direction of development— to reach a predetermined goal, such as a fully working prototype or to complete a course assessment. When Git uses the analogy of a tree (with branches), this main direction could be thought of as the ‘trunk’ of your development flow.\nSo far, we have only committed changes to one branch, the default branch called main, which, in our tree analogy, can be thought of as the trunk. If you are working on your own, or with a small group and you are not all committing changes at the same time, this can be a valid approach and avoids a lot of complexity in using Git.\nBranches allow you to ‘branch off’ from the trunk in a new direction, which we may then add back to our trunk at a later time (see next paragraph). On this new branch, you can experiment with new ideas or work away in isolation, committing to Git and pushing your changes to GitHub, safe in the knowledge that nothing you do will affect the main direction of development. Likewise, the main direction of development on main can carry on in parallel with its own changes, and these will not affect your isolated branch.\nIt’s possible to merge the changes made in a branch, into another branch (usually the main branch). For example, if you created a branch to try out an experiment and the experiment was a success, Git enables you to merge those changes back into the main branch, or main direction of development, then you can delete your branch as it’s no longer needed. Or, if the experiment failed, you can leave the branch and never speak of it again, although it will still be stored if you decide later it is a good idea after all, or you can safely delete the branch.\nSimilarly, you can merge the changes from`main into your branch. This is useful if, for example, main has had updates made to it since you ‘branched off’, and you would like to see these updates in your branch.\nGit offers another method to merge branches called rebase, which is why the Git term for merging branches is integration as this covers both methods. Although rebase has some advantages, you can risk losing work when using it, so it won’t be covered in this course."

This is particularly helpful when working collaboratively.\nIn Git, a branch represents a distinct version of the main repository, serving as a snapshot of your changes. When implementing new features or addressing issues, regardless of their scope, creating a new branch is the practice to isolate your modifications. This approach enhances code stability in the main branch and affords you the opportunity to refine your history before merging it into the primary codebase.\nWhen the work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main project. You can even switch between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other.\nWe are also going to learn about Git’s stash feature, and how it can help you when switching between branches."

    "text": "4.3 Merge conflicts\nIn the examples above we have introduced create a branch, making some changes and then integrating this back into main. However, what happens if you make a change to a line in a file on one branch, then you (or someone else) changes the same line of the same file on a different branch, what should Git do when you want to merge? This is a so-called merge conflict.\nIn this section, we’re going to create a simple scenario where we will run into merge conflicts and explore two different ways to resolve them.\nWhen using merge to combine two branches, Git will first find a common “base commit” between the two branches, then compare the changes since this commit and attempt to compile a change list known as a “merge commit”.\nGit tries to automate this process as much as possible, but if it finds two conflicting changes it won’t try to guess which change should overrule the other. This usually happens when the same line in a file has been changed in both branches. In this case, while attempting to compile the merge commit, Git will go into a “merge conflict” state, which involves updating the conflicting files in the filesystem (or “working tree”) with some special formatting to show you what it cannot guess, and Git will not allow you to commit the merge until you have manually decided what you want to happen.\nLet’s create a branch named capitalise and switch to it:\n\n\nCommand-line\nGitHub Desktop\n\n\n\n\nCodegit switch -c capitalise\n\n\nSwitched to a new branch 'capitalise'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we’re going to make a different change to the file on the main branch. This time change the contents to the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexample.md\n\n\n\nHELLO\n\n\nThen commit the change:\n\n\nCommand-line\nGitHub Desktop\n\n\n\n\nCodegit add example.md\ngit commit -m \"Capitalise example.md\"\n\n\n[capitalise 3da9dfb] Capitalise example.md\n\n1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 3 deletions(-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow switch back to the main branch:\n\n\nCommand-line\nGitHub Desktop\n\n\n\n\nCodegit switch main\n\n\n\nSwitched to branch 'main'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file should look like it did before the capitalisation, as that change is isolated on the capitalise branch:\n\n\nCommand-line\nGitHub Desktop\n\n\n\n\nCodecat example.md\n\n\nHello?\n\nIs it me you're looking for?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we’re going to make a different change to the file on the main branch.

The line (or lines) between &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and ====== here show what you already had (you can tell because HEAD points to your current branch). The line (or lines) between ======= and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is what was introduced by the other commit, in this case from the capitalise branch.\nIf this was a large file with multiple lines changed, Git will automatically merge the parts that it can, and will highlight the parts it can’t like this, and we will have to go through each conflict and manually resolve them.\nLet’s have a look at Git’s status:\n\n\nCommand-line\nGitHub Desktop\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngit status -v\n\n\n\nOn branch main\n\nYou have unmerged paths.\n\n(fix conflicts and run \"git commit\")\n\n(use \"git merge --abort\" to abort the merge)\n\nUnmerged paths:\n\n(use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to mark resolution)\n\nboth modified:   example.md\n\n* Unmerged path example.md\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n\n\n\nNote that GitHub Desktop displays the conflict icon besides each file that needs attention:\n\n\n\n\nGit’s method for displaying merge conflicts by modifying the source files makes it very straightforward for us to resolve, by just manually editing the files as we want. However Git knows that there is now a danger that you could commit this merge conflict syntax, and when working with code, this will almost certainly cause a syntax error and break your project. So Git tries to protect us against this by going into a “merge conflict” state, where it wants you to either resolve or abort this action before you do anything else.\nLet’s manually edit our file to what we want, like a mixture of both changes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexample.md\n\n\n\nHELLO.\n\n\n\n\nCommand-line\nGitHub Desktop\n\n\n\nAdd the file to the stage to mark it as resolved:\n\nCodegit add example.md\n\n\nWe can see Git is no longer in a merge conflict state:\n\nCodegit status -v\n\n\n\nOn branch main\n\nAll conflicts fixed but you are still merging.\n\n(use \"git commit\" to conclude merge)\n\nChanges to be committed:\n\nmodified:   example.md\n\ndiff --git a/example.md b/example.md\n\nindex 8b94e8e..c886167 100644\n\n--- a/example.md\n\n+++ b/example.md\n\n@@ -1,2 +1,2 @@\n\n-Hello.\n\n+HELLO.\n\n\n\nOnce the special &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, ====== and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; syntax is removed from our files, GitHub Desktop detects that our merge conflict has been resolved and allows us to ‘Continue Merge’:\n\n\n\n\nAnd we can conclude the merge.\n\n\nCommand-line\nGitHub Desktop\n\n\n\nI use the --no-edit flag to tell Git to use the default message for a merge commit:\n\nCode\ngit commit --no-edit\n\n\n\n[main fe2d762] Merge branch 'capitalise'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have integrated our branch into the main branch and we can safely delete our short-lived branch capitalise:\n\n\nCommand-line\nGitHub Desktop\n\n\n\n\nCodegit branch --delete capitalise\n\n\nDeleted branch capitalise (was 3da9dfb)."

    "text": "4.2 Switching branches with the help of Git stash\nGiven the example above, branching with Git appears straightforward. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes Git won’t let you switch branches. Let’s create a scenario where we see an error when switching branches, try to understand why Git is stopping us, and look at a simple universal solution.\nCreate and switch to a new branch called question:\n\n\nCommand-line\nGitHub Desktop\n\n\n\n\nCodegit switch -c question\n\n\n\nSwitched to a new branch 'question'\n\n\n\nFrom the main menu select Branch &gt; New Branch and name the branch ‘question’:\n\n\n\n\nLet’s make a change to the file by changing the exclamation mark to a question mark:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexample.md\n\n\n\nHello?\n\n\nAdd the change to the stage and commit:\n\n\nCommand-line\nGitHub Desktop\n\n\n\n\nCodegit add example.md\ngit commit -m \"Change exclamation mark to question mark\"\n\n\n[question 49806f4] Change exclamation mark to question mark\n\n1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s make another change to our file:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexample.md\n\n\n\nHello?\nIs it me you’re looking for?\n\n\nThis time, instead of committing, we will try to switch back to the main branch, and Git will tell us we can’t switch branches currently as we would lose our local changes (see the next example for the error). Committing our latest change would let us then switch the branch, but what if we don’t want to commit the change?\n\n\nCommand-line\nGitHub Desktop\n\n\n\nA common scenario is that you have started working on a problem, then when you check Git you realise you are working on the wrong branch, but now you have uncommitted changes and can’t switch branches. For this scenario, there is the stash. Think of it as a clipboard with cut-and-paste functionality like you would have in a text editor, which will let us ‘cut’ our changes and store them somewhere safe, let us switch branches, and then paste them.\nLet’s try it now:\n\nCodegit switch main\n\n\n\nerror: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:\n\nexample.md\n\nPlease commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.\n\nAborting\n\nGit complains that we will lose our local changes. Let’s try out the stash:\n\nCodegit stash\n\n\n\nSaved working directory and index state WIP on question: 49806f4 Change exclamation mark to question mark\n\nGit has used the abbreviation ‘WIP’ which stands for ‘Work In Progress’.\nNow if we look at our file we’ll see the 2nd line has disappeared:\n\nCodecat example.md\n\n\n\nHello?\n\nWe can ask Git to show us our stash:\n\nCodegit stash show\n\n\n\nexample.md | 2 ++\n\n1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)\n\nThis shows us which files have changed. We can add a -p (for ‘patch’) flag which will show us a diff:\n\nCodegit stash show -p\n\n\n\ndiff --git a/example.md b/example.md\n\nindex ebbc6cd..472b4c5 100644\n\n--- a/example.md\n\n+++ b/example.md\n\n@@ -1,2 +1,4 @@\n\nHello?\n\n+Is it me you're looking for?\n\n+\nNow our local copy is ‘clean’ and we can safely switch branches:\n\nCodegit switch main\n\n\nSwitched to branch 'main'\nAnd we can apply our change to a different branch:\n\nCodegit stash apply\n\n\n\nAuto-merging example.md\n\nOn branch main\n\nChanges not staged for commit:\n\n(use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to update what will be committed)\n\n(use \"git restore &lt;file&gt;...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\nmodified:   example.md\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n\nAnd now if we look at the file, we’ll see our stashed change has been applied, but there is no question mark on “Hello?” as this change still resides on the question branch:\n\nCodecat example.md\n\n\n\nHello!\n\nIs it me you're looking for?\n\nWe can now safely remove our stashed version:\n\nCodegit stash drop\n\n\n\nDropped refs/stash@{0} (00b8825ce0b6a0e3c2877f3c42c828fb4da4c922)\n\nIt’s important to drop the stash afterwards, or you’ll end up with several items in the stash that could lead to applying the wrong one. Git has a shortcut for ‘apply then drop’ which is git stash pop.\n\n\nLuckily for GitHub Desktop users, this stashing and stash-applying process is all handled by clicking a button.\nOnce we try to switch to the main branch:\n\nGitHub Desktop offers us two options:\n\nLeave my changes on question allows us to stash the changes and come back to the branch later and apply the stash\nBring my changes to main automates the process of stashing the changes, switching to the desired branch, and applying the stash.\n\nFor this tutorial, we will choose the latter option— ‘Bring my changes to main’:\n\nAnd now if we look at the file, we’ll see our stashed change has been applied, but no question mark as this change still resides on the question branch:\n\n\n\n\nLet’s stage and commit our 2nd line:\n\n\nCommand-line\nGitHub Desktop\n\n\n\n\nCodegit add example.md\n\n\ngit commit -m \"Add 2nd line\"\n[main 6859b82] Add 2nd line\n1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s merge in the question mark.\n\n\nCommand-line\nGitHub Desktop\n\n\n\n\nCodegit merge question\n\n\n\nAuto-merging example.md\n\nMerge made by the 'ort' strategy.\n\nexample.md | 2 +-\n\n1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check the file:\n\n\nCommand-line\nGitHub Desktop\n\n\n\n\nCodecat example.md\n\n\n\nHello?\n\nIs it me you're looking for?"
